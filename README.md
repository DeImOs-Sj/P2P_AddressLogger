## P2P Address Logger: Avail DA Network Tracker

This project implements a P2P Address Logger on Avail DA, a decentralized network technology. It tracks and logs all peers that connect to the network, creating a map of the connected devices.

**Additional Features:**

* **Potential for Network Analysis:** By storing historical data, the logger can be used to analyze network activity and identify patterns in peer connections.
* **Privacy Considerations:** (Describe how the project handles user privacy. Does it anonymize addresses? Can users opt-out of being logged?)

**Project Setup**

1. **Install Avail CLI:**

   ```bash
   npm i -g @availproject/cli
   ```

2. **and Run**

    ```
    avail lc up
    ```
